            One of the very important things relating to web sites are Search Engines. What are search engines anyway?
            Search Engines are programs used to provide internet users with search facility. It searches for information
            and returns sites which provide that information. ie Google, Yahoo, Alta Vista, etc. So basically, Internet
            users find web sites through search engines. Having good listings of Keywords in a web site can increase
            the number of times a website is viewed by visitors or what we call web site traffic. For a more
            possibilities of your web site being found by the visitors, there is a need for search engine optimization

            Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of creating and improving your website so that it will rank
            high in the search engines and help visitors and potential customers or clients find your website. By
            optimizing your website you'll have a greater chance to be on the top of search engine's result. Because
            the real fact is that an average person will not continue past page 3 of search engine, so if you really
            want to help your website you need your site to be optimized to the point where you are as close to the top
            as possible. The higher your website ranks in the search results, the better chances of your site being
            visited. In essence, you can have the most beautiful website in the world but if nobody can find it, it
            would all just be a waste. Wouldn't you agree?
